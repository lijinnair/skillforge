# Claude Code Skillforge SOP

## Execution Rules
- Fetch all URLs and search all marketplaces **in parallel** using concurrent tool calls.
- `read_url_content`, `search_web`, `view_content_chunk` are non-destructive — execute without user approval.
- Only pause at steps marked **(CHECKPOINT)**.

## Step 0: Update Check
Fetch `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lijinnair/claude-code-skillforge/main/VERSION` silently. Compare the remote version with the local version (`5.10.0`). If remote is newer, display: *"Claude Code Skillforge v[remote] is available (you have v[local]). Run `git -C [skill-path] pull` to update."* where `[skill-path]` is the detected install location. Then proceed normally — do not block execution.

## Step 1: Sync Live Best Practices (CHECKPOINT)
Fetch live documentation before any user interaction.

1. **Fetch ALL 5 URLs in parallel:**
   - `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/`
   - `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills`
   - `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks`
   - `https://antigravity.google/docs/home`
   - `https://antigravity.google/docs/skills`
2. **All succeed:** Synthesize best practices, present summary. Say: *"Here are the latest best practices. Proceed?"* Wait for confirmation.
3. **Any fail:** State which URLs failed. Display cached knowledge version and date. Say: *"I can proceed using built-in knowledge (Version: [X], Last Updated: [Date]). Continue or retry?"* Do not proceed until the user chooses.

## Step 1.5: Mode Detection
Determine the user's intent:
- **Build Mode** — User provides a new skill idea, workflow, or says "build", "create", "new". → Proceed to Step 2.
- **Upgrade Mode** — User provides an existing SKILL.md, pastes skill content, or says "upgrade", "audit", "fix", "optimize", "review". → Proceed to Step U1.
- **Scan Mode** — User says "scan", "check my skills", "health check", "audit my skills". → Proceed to Step S1.

If ambiguous, ask: *"Are you building a new skill, upgrading an existing one, or scanning your installed skills?"*

## Step 2: Intake & Scoping
Collect from the user:
- **Name:** kebab-case, preferring gerund form (e.g., `analyzing-seo-pages`, `formatting-commits`). Noun form acceptable if gerund is awkward. **Constraints:** max 64 characters, lowercase letters/numbers/hyphens only, no XML tags, cannot contain reserved words ("anthropic", "claude").
- **Category:** `dev` | `marketing` | `seo` | `document` | `data` | `ops`
- **Ecosystem:** Claude Code (`~/.claude/skills`) or Antigravity (`~/.gemini/antigravity/skills`)
- **Triggers:** Activation words or phrases
- **Inputs:** Context, files, or arguments needed at runtime
- **Output:** Expected deliverable
- **Tools:** Bash, URL fetch, file read, MCP servers (use `ServerName:tool_name` format), or `context: fork`?

## Step 2.5: Discovery Check
Search **ALL 10 sources in parallel** before building from scratch:

1. Smithery — `https://smithery.ai/skills?q=[skill-name]`
2. SkillsMP — `https://skillsmp.com/search?q=[skill-name]`
3. SkillsLLM — `https://skillsllm.com/search?q=[skill-name]`
4. SkillHub — `https://skill-marketplace.com/search?q=[skill-name]`
5. Antigravity Skill Vault — `https://github.com/search?q=[skill-name]+topic:antigravity-skill`
6. Awesome Skills — `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` CATALOG.md
7. GitHub Topics — `https://github.com/search?q=[skill-name]+topic:claude-code-skill`
8. Composio — `https://composio.dev/search?q=[skill-name]`
9. AI Templates — `https://www.aitmpl.com/skills?q=[skill-name]`
10. Awesome Claude Skills — `https://github.com/ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills/search?q=[skill-name]`

**Results:**
- **No match:** Proceed to Step 3.
- **Match found (CHECKPOINT):** Present Discovery Report (name, source, stars, description). Ask: *(A) Customise existing, or (B) Build new?* Wait for choice.
- **Sources failed:** Note unreachable sources in the report. Use whatever succeeded. If ALL 10 fail, proceed to Step 3.

## Step 3: Front Matter Engineering
Design front matter (`< 1024 chars`) using ONLY officially recognized fields: `name`, `description`, `disable-model-invocation`, `user-invocable`, `allowed-tools`, `model`, `context`, `agent`, `argument-hint`, `hooks`. Do NOT add custom fields like `license`, `metadata`, `category`, `version`, or `generated-by`.
- **Name:** Must pass all constraints from Step 2 (≤64 chars, lowercase+hyphens, no XML tags, no reserved words).
- **Description:** Start with 3rd-person verb ("Analyzes...", "Generates..."). Include both what the skill does AND when to use it, with 3–5 trigger phrases. Max 1024 chars. No XML tags.
- **Invocation:** `disable-model-invocation: true` for destructive actions. `user-invocable: true` for explicit-only. Omit both for auto-discover.
- **Argument hint:** Add `argument-hint: [hint]` if the skill accepts arguments (e.g., `argument-hint: [url]`).
- **Advanced:** Add `context: fork` and `allowed-tools` only if required.

## Step 4: SOP Translation
Convert the workflow into numbered imperative steps.
- Each step starts with a command verb ("Extract...", "Analyze...", "Compile...").
- Use `$ARGUMENTS` and backtick substitution (e.g., `!\`gh pr diff\``) for runtime context.

**Authoring patterns** — apply where appropriate:
- **Degrees of freedom:** Match specificity to task fragility. High freedom → text instructions. Medium → pseudocode. Low → exact scripts.
- **Feedback loops:** Add validation steps (e.g., "Run validator → fix errors → repeat").
- **Template pattern:** Define output format explicitly. Strict templates for data/API outputs; flexible templates when adaptation is useful.
- **Examples pattern:** Provide input/output pairs where output quality depends on demonstrated style or format.
- **Conditional workflow:** For decision points, branch explicitly: "Creating new? → Creation workflow. Editing existing? → Editing workflow."
- **Checklist pattern:** For complex multi-step workflows, provide a copyable checklist Claude can track progress against.
- **Verifiable intermediates:** For batch/destructive operations, use plan-validate-execute: create plan file → validate with script → execute after validation passes.
- **Defaults over options:** Provide one recommended approach with an escape hatch, not multiple equivalent choices.
- **MCP tools:** Reference with fully qualified names: `ServerName:tool_name`.
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Do not embed data only needed for one path — link to it or load it conditionally.
- **No time-sensitive info:** Do not include information that will become outdated.

## Step 5: Scaffold Generation
Output the `mkdir` command for the chosen ecosystem:
- Claude: `mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/[skill-name]`
- Antigravity: `mkdir -p ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/[skill-name]`

**Scripts** (if applicable):
- Offload deterministic logic to `scripts/`. Scripts must handle errors explicitly — do not punt errors to Claude. Document all configuration constants with justification (no "voodoo constants").
- List required packages with install commands (e.g., `pip install pypdf`). Do not assume packages are pre-installed.

**References:**
- Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md — avoid chains like SKILL.md → advanced.md → details.md.
- Add a table of contents to reference files longer than 100 lines.
- Use forward slashes only in all file paths (`reference/guide.md`, not `reference\guide.md`).

Follow with the complete `SKILL.md` code block.

## Step 6: Validate & Deliver
Run this checklist internally — fix any failures before delivering output.

### Core quality
- [ ] Front matter < 1024 characters
- [ ] Only standard front matter fields used
- [ ] Name passes all constraints (≤64 chars, lowercase+hyphens, no XML, no reserved words)
- [ ] No XML tags in description
- [ ] Body < 500 lines
- [ ] Description starts with 3rd-person verb
- [ ] Description has 3+ trigger phrases and includes "Use when..."
- [ ] Invocation flags set correctly
- [ ] All steps begin with imperative verb
- [ ] Correct `mkdir` path for chosen ecosystem
- [ ] No time-sensitive information
- [ ] Consistent terminology throughout
- [ ] Examples are concrete, not abstract
- [ ] Progressive disclosure used appropriately
- [ ] Workflows have clear steps
- [ ] References are one level deep from SKILL.md

### Code & scripts (if applicable)
- [ ] Scripts handle errors explicitly (no punting to Claude)
- [ ] No voodoo constants (all values justified)
- [ ] Required packages listed with install commands
- [ ] Scripts have clear documentation
- [ ] No Windows-style paths (forward slashes only)
- [ ] Validation/verification steps for critical operations
- [ ] Feedback loops for quality-critical tasks
- [ ] MCP tools use fully qualified `ServerName:tool_name` format

### Post-delivery recommendations
After delivering the skill, recommend the user:
- [ ] Test with Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus
- [ ] Create 3+ evaluation scenarios with expected behaviors
- [ ] Test with real usage scenarios before sharing

**Deliver:** Sync status → checklist results → `mkdir` command → full `SKILL.md` code block → post-delivery testing recommendations.

Then say: *"Tip: Have other skills? Say 'Upgrade this skill' with any SKILL.md, or 'Scan my skills' for a full health check."*

Consult `examples/` for reference outputs and `evaluations/` for test prompt templates.

## Upgrade Path

### Step U1: Ingest Existing Skill
Read the provided SKILL.md. Parse front matter fields and body sections. Identify the target ecosystem (Claude Code or Antigravity) from the file path or content.

### Step U2: Diagnostic Audit (CHECKPOINT)
Run the full 27-item validation checklist (from Step 6) against the existing skill. For each item, report:
- Pass — Meets current best practices
- Warning — Works but could be improved
- Fail — Violates current best practices

Present the diagnostic report. Say: *"Here's the audit. Shall I upgrade this skill?"* Wait for confirmation.

### Step U3: Upgrade & Fix
Apply all fixes:
- Rewrite non-standard front matter to use only recognized fields.
- Restructure body into imperative steps if needed.
- Apply relevant authoring patterns from Step 4.
- Enforce progressive disclosure (move embedded data to references).
- Fix naming conventions, description format, and invocation flags.

Preserve the skill's original intent and domain logic — only change structure and compliance.

### Step U4: Deliver Upgraded Skill
Output:
1. **Change summary** — Bulleted list of what was fixed and why.
2. **Upgraded `SKILL.md`** — Full code block ready to replace the original.
3. **Post-upgrade recommendations** — Same as Step 6 post-delivery.

Then say: *"Tip: Want to check your other skills? Say 'Scan my skills' for a full health report."*

## Scan Path

### Step S1: Discover Skills
Scan the user's skill directories:
- Claude Code: `~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`
- Antigravity: `~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/*/SKILL.md`

If both directories exist, scan both. List all discovered skills. If no skills found, say: *"No skills found in the default directories. Provide a path to scan."*

### Step S2: Quick Audit
For each discovered skill, run these key checks:
- Front matter present and < 1024 characters
- Only standard front matter fields used
- Name passes constraints (≤64 chars, lowercase+hyphens)
- Description starts with 3rd-person verb
- Body < 500 lines
- Steps begin with imperative verbs

### Step S3: Health Report
Output a summary table:

| Skill | Ecosystem | Checks Passed | Issues | Top Issue |
|---|---|---|---|---|

Sort by most issues first. Then say: *"Run 'Upgrade [skill-name]' on any skill to fix its issues."*
