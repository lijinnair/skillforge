description: Generates highly optimized Agent Skills for both native Claude Code and the Antigravity system, according to official best practices and the "Progressive Disclosure" strategy. Use when the user wants to build a new skill, turn a workflow into a skill, optimize an existing prompt, or structure agent instructions for either ecosystem.

# Skillforge SOP

## Execution Rules
- Fetch all URLs and search all marketplaces **in parallel** using concurrent tool calls.
- `read_url_content`, `search_web`, `view_content_chunk` are non-destructive — execute without user approval.
- Only pause at steps marked **(CHECKPOINT)**.

## Step 0: Update Check
Fetch `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lijinnair/skillforge/main/VERSION` silently. Compare the remote version with the local version (`5.6.0`). If remote is newer, display: *"Skillforge v[remote] is available (you have v[local]). Run `git -C [skill-path] pull` to update."* where `[skill-path]` is the detected install location. Then proceed normally — do not block execution.

## Step 1: Sync Live Docs (CHECKPOINT)
Fetch live documentation before any user interaction.

1. **Fetch ALL 5 URLs in parallel:**
   - `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/`
   - `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills`
   - `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks`
   - `https://antigravity.google/docs/home`
   - `https://antigravity.google/docs/skills`
2. **All succeed:** Synthesize best practices, present summary. Say: *"Here are the latest best practices. Proceed?"* Wait for confirmation.
3. **Any fail:** State which URLs failed. Display cached knowledge version and date. Say: *"I can proceed using built-in knowledge (Version: [X], Last Updated: [Date]). Continue or retry?"* Do not proceed until the user chooses.

## Step 2: Intake & Scoping
Collect from the user:
- **Name:** kebab-case, preferring gerund form (e.g., `analyzing-seo-pages`, `formatting-commits`). Noun form is acceptable if gerund is awkward.
- **Category:** `dev` | `marketing` | `seo` | `document` | `data` | `ops`
- **Ecosystem:** Claude Code (`~/.claude/skills`) or Antigravity (`~/.gemini/antigravity/skills`)
- **Triggers:** Activation words or phrases
- **Inputs:** Context, files, or arguments needed at runtime
- **Output:** Expected deliverable
- **Tools:** Bash, URL fetch, file read, or `context: fork`?

## Step 2.5: Discovery Check
Search **ALL 9 sources in parallel** before building from scratch:

1. Smithery — `https://smithery.ai/skills?q=[skill-name]`
2. SkillsMP — `https://skillsmp.com/search?q=[skill-name]`
3. SkillsLLM — `https://skillsllm.com/search?q=[skill-name]`
4. SkillHub — `https://skill-marketplace.com/search?q=[skill-name]`
5. Antigravity Skill Vault — `https://github.com/search?q=[skill-name]+topic:antigravity-skill`
6. Awesome Skills — `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` CATALOG.md
7. GitHub Topics — `https://github.com/search?q=[skill-name]+topic:claude-code-skill`
8. Composio — `https://composio.dev/search?q=[skill-name]`
9. AI Templates — `https://www.aitmpl.com/skills?q=[skill-name]`

**Results:**
- **No match:** Proceed to Step 3.
- **Match found (CHECKPOINT):** Present Discovery Report (name, source, stars, description). Ask: *(A) Customise existing, or (B) Build new?* Wait for choice.
- **Sources failed:** Note unreachable sources in the report. Use whatever succeeded. If ALL 9 fail, proceed to Step 3.

## Step 3: Front Matter Engineering
Design front matter (`< 1024 chars`) using ONLY officially recognized fields: `name`, `description`, `disable-model-invocation`, `user-invocable`, `allowed-tools`, `model`, `context`, `agent`, `argument-hint`, `hooks`. Do NOT add custom fields like `license`, `metadata`, `category`, `version`, or `generated-by`.
- **Description:** Start with 3rd-person verb ("Analyzes...", "Generates..."). Include both what the skill does AND when to use it, with 3–5 trigger phrases.
- **Invocation:** `disable-model-invocation: true` for destructive actions. `user-invocable: true` for explicit-only. Omit both for auto-discover.
- **Argument hint:** Add `argument-hint: [hint]` if the skill accepts arguments (e.g., `argument-hint: [url]`).
- **Advanced:** Add `context: fork` and `allowed-tools` only if required.

## Step 4: SOP Translation
Convert the workflow into numbered imperative steps.
- Each step starts with a command verb ("Extract...", "Analyze...", "Compile...").
- Use `$ARGUMENTS` and backtick substitution (e.g., `!\`gh pr diff\``) for runtime context.
- **Degrees of freedom:** Match specificity to task fragility. High freedom (multiple valid approaches) → text instructions. Medium freedom (preferred pattern) → pseudocode. Low freedom (fragile operations) → exact scripts. Not every skill needs rigid imperative steps.
- **Feedback loops:** Where applicable, add a validation step (e.g., "Run validator → fix errors → repeat"). This pattern greatly improves output quality.
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Do not embed data only needed for one path — link to it or load it conditionally.
- **No time-sensitive info:** Do not include information that will become outdated (dates, version numbers, trending tools).

## Step 5: Scaffold Generation
Output the `mkdir` command for the chosen ecosystem:
- Claude: `mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/[skill-name]`
- Antigravity: `mkdir -p ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/[skill-name]`

Offload deterministic logic to `scripts/` if applicable. Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md — avoid chains like SKILL.md → advanced.md → details.md. Follow with the complete `SKILL.md` code block.

## Step 6: Validate & Deliver
Run this checklist internally — fix any failures before delivering output.

- [ ] Front matter < 1024 characters
- [ ] Only standard front matter fields used (no `license`, `metadata`, `category`, `version`, `generated-by`)
- [ ] Body < 500 lines
- [ ] Description starts with 3rd-person verb
- [ ] Description has 3+ trigger phrases and includes "Use when..."
- [ ] Invocation flags set correctly
- [ ] All steps begin with imperative verb
- [ ] Correct `mkdir` path for chosen ecosystem
- [ ] No time-sensitive information
- [ ] Consistent terminology throughout
- [ ] References are one level deep from SKILL.md

**Deliver:** Sync status → checklist results → `mkdir` command → full `SKILL.md` code block.

Consult `examples/` for reference outputs.
