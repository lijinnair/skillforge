## ✅ Contribution Guidelines

### Editing `SKILL.md`
- Keep the file **under 500 lines**.
- Keep the **Front Matter under 1024 characters**.
- All SOP steps must begin with an **imperative command verb**.
- Do NOT remove the **Interactive Checkpoint** or the **Self-Validation Checklist** — these are core safety features.
- Bump the version number in the Front Matter metadata (`version: "X.Y.Z"`) and add a corresponding entry to `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Adding Examples
- New examples go in the `examples/` directory.
- Use the naming convention: `[skill-name].SKILL.md`.
- The example must be a real, working skill (not a placeholder).
- Include the `generated-by: skillforge` metadata field.

### Updating Documentation
- Keep `README.md` concise — the 5-section format (What/Why/When/Where/How) should be preserved.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` for every meaningful change using [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format.

## 🧠 Philosophy
This project follows the **Progressive Disclosure** principle — less is more. When in doubt, link to external docs rather than embedding them. Every line added to `SKILL.md` has a cost in tokens, so make it count.
