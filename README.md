## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone into your Antigravity skills directory
git clone https://github.com/lijinnair/skillforge ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/skillforge

# Or into native Claude Code
git clone https://github.com/lijinnair/skillforge ~/.claude/skills/skillforge
```

Then just say: **"I want to build a new skill"** or run **`/skillforge`**

## What It Does

Skillforge is a meta-skill — an AI agent that builds other AI agents. Give it a raw idea or messy workflow, and it outputs a deploy-ready `SKILL.md` file that follows every official best practice.

**The pipeline:**

| Step | What happens |
|---:|---|
| 1 | **Live Docs Sync** — Fetches latest rules from `code.claude.com` and `antigravity.google` |
| 2 | **Intake** — Collects your skill name, category, ecosystem, triggers, inputs, and outputs |
| 3 | **Discovery** — Searches 9 marketplaces in parallel to find existing similar skills |
| 4 | **Front Matter** — Engineers a spec-compliant, sub-1024-char metadata block |
| 5 | **SOP Translation** — Converts your workflow into an imperative execution pipeline |
| 6 | **Self-Validation** — Audits its own output against 8 rules before delivery |

## Why It Exists

Most AI skills are written like essays. Skillforge enforces **Progressive Disclosure** — the principle that every token in the context window must earn its place:

- Minimal footprint in the context window
- Deterministic logic offloaded to `scripts/`
- Examples and references loaded only when needed
- Strict imperative pipelines, not conversational prose

The result: skills that are faster, more reliable, and cheaper to run.

## Features

- **Dual ecosystem** — Generates skills for Claude Code or Antigravity
- **Live doc sync** — Always builds against the latest official spec
- **9-source discovery** — Searches Smithery, SkillsMP, SkillsLLM, SkillHub, Composio, AI Templates, GitHub Topics, and more before building from scratch
- **Graceful fallback** — If docs are unreachable, surfaces cached version and asks before proceeding
- **Self-validating** — 11-point checklist catches errors before you see the output
- **Token-optimized** — The skill itself practices what it preaches (< 100 lines, ~1,100 tokens)
- **Self-updating** — Checks for newer versions on GitHub before every run, with a one-line update notice
